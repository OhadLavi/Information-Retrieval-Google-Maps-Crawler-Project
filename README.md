# Information Retrieval - Google Maps API Crawler
## Preview


## Description
This project is a part of the Information Retrieval course, aiming to enhance the search experience on Google Maps through a custom-built crawler using the Google Places API. Three unique features have been added to improve search functionality beyond what is available on the official Google Maps website:

1. **Rating Range Filter**: Users can filter places based on a specified range of ratings, for instance, between 3 and 4.

2. **Minimum Reviews Filter**: This feature allows users to filter places based on the minimum number of reviews written about a particular location.

3. **Opening Hours Range Filter**: Users can filter places based on the opening hours within a specified range. For example, open on Fridays from 10:00 to 14:00.

## Integration with Google Maps
The results of our filtering searches are seamlessly integrated with Google Maps. This allows users to visualize the location of each place directly on the map.

## Project Structure

### 1. Crawler (Node.js Project)
The crawler is implemented using Node.js to extract data from the Google Places API.

### 2. Website (Frontend and Backend)
The website comprises both frontend and backend components, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the filtered search results.
